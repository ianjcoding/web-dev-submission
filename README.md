# The Big Three Anime Webpage

This project is a **multi-page website** dedicated to the "Big Three" of anime — *Naruto*, *One Piece*, and *Bleach*.  
It introduces the series, their cultural impact, the main characters, and their power systems.  
The site also includes an extra section covering the "Uncrowned King," *Hunter x Hunter*, explaining why it is not considered part of the Big Three.
