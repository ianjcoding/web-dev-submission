    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      One of the most defining features of the Big Three is their unique and memorable power systems. 
      Each reflects the themes of its story and adds depth to character growth and battles.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h2>One Piece – Devil Fruits & Haki</h2>
      <p>
        In One Piece, characters gain supernatural abilities by consuming <strong>Devil Fruits</strong>, 
        which come in three types: Paramecia, Zoan, and Logia. Each fruit grants immense power but 
        takes away the ability to swim. Complementing this is <strong>Haki</strong>, a spiritual force 
        that allows users to sense presence, exert willpower, or reinforce attacks. Together, they 
        embody the themes of freedom, will, and individuality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Haki is divided into three main types: Kenbunshoku Haki (Observation Haki), Busoshoku Haki (Armament Haki), 
        and Haoshoku Haki (Conqueror's Haki). Each type serves a different purpose in combat and strategy, 
        allowing characters to adapt to various situations. The mastery of Haki often signifies a character's growth 
        and strength, making it a crucial element in the One Piece world.</p>
        <p>Devil Fruits are rare and unique, with each fruit granting a specific ability that can range from elemental control
        to physical transformations. The diversity of Devil Fruit powers adds a layer of unpredictability to battles,
        as characters must adapt to their opponents' abilities. The inability to swim after consuming a Devil Fruit
        also introduces a strategic vulnerability, emphasizing the importance of balance between power and weakness.
        </p>
        <p>Overall, the combination of Devil Fruits and Haki creates a rich and dynamic power system that enhances the storytelling</p>

      <h2>Naruto – Chakra & Jutsu</h2>
      <p>
        Naruto’s power system revolves around <strong>Chakra</strong>, the energy that fuels all ninja techniques. 
        Chakra is divided into elemental natures and can be shaped into <strong>Jutsu</strong>: 
        Ninjutsu, Taijutsu, and Genjutsu. The system expands with Kekkei Genkai (unique genetic abilities) 
        and Tailed Beast chakra. This system reflects balance between innate potential, training, and 
        the bonds between people.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chakra is a blend of physical and spiritual energy, and its manipulation is essential for performing various 
        ninja techniques. Ninjutsu involves the use of chakra to create elemental attacks, while Taijutsu focuses on 
        physical combat. Genjutsu, on the other hand, manipulates the opponent's senses, creating illusions. The 
        versatility of chakra allows for a wide range of abilities, making it a fundamental aspect of the Naruto universe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kekkei Genkai are unique abilities passed down through specific bloodlines, such as the Sharingan and Byakugan. 
        These abilities often provide significant advantages in battle, further emphasizing the importance of heritage 
        and lineage in the series. The Tailed Beasts, powerful entities with immense chakra, also play a crucial role 
        in the story, symbolizing the themes of power, control, and acceptance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, the chakra and jutsu system in Naruto is intricate and multifaceted, allowing for diverse combat styles 
        and character development. It highlights the importance of hard work, perseverance, and the connections between 
        individuals in achieving true strength.
        </p>
        <p>The chakra system is deeply intertwined with the themes of the series, such as the importance of bonds and teamwork.
        Characters often draw strength from their relationships with others, and the concept of chakra reflects this interconnectedness.
        </p>

      <h2>Bleach – Spiritual Energy & Zanpakutō</h2>
      <p>
        In Bleach, the essence of combat is <strong>Reiryoku</strong> (spiritual energy). 
        Soul Reapers channel this energy through their <strong>Zanpakutō</strong>, each possessing 
        unique abilities revealed in Shikai and further evolved in Bankai forms. Other spiritual 
        beings like Quincy and Hollows introduce opposing systems. This reflects the series’ core 
        theme of identity and the balance between worlds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reiryoku is the spiritual energy that all beings possess, and it is the source of power for Soul Reapers, 
        Hollows, and Quincies. Soul Reapers use their Reiryoku to perform various techniques, including their 
        signature weapon, the Zanpakutō. Each Zanpakutō has its own unique abilities and personality, which are 
        revealed through the Shikai and Bankai forms. The mastery of one's Zanpakutō is a significant milestone in 
        a Soul Reaper's growth and development.
        </p>
        <p>
        Quincies, on the other hand, utilize spiritual energy in a different way, focusing on absorbing and manipulating
        it to create powerful weapons and techniques. Hollows, as corrupted spirits, also possess unique abilities
        derived from their spiritual energy. The interactions and conflicts between these different spiritual beings
        highlight the themes of identity, power, and the balance between different worlds.
        </p>
        <p>
        Overall, the spiritual energy and Zanpakutō system in Bleach is complex and multifaceted, allowing for diverse
        combat styles and character development. It emphasizes the importance of self-discovery, growth, and the
        connections between different realms and beings.
        </p>

        <h2>Hunter × Hunter – Nen</h2>
        <p>
            Easily the most diverse, detailed and complex of the four, Hunter × Hunter's Nen system allows users to manipulate their own life energy (aura) in various ways.
            Nen is divided into six categories: Enhancement, Emission, Manipulation, Transmutation, Conjuration, and Specialization. Each user has a natural affinity for one category but can learn to use others through training.
            The system emphasizes creativity, strategy, and personal growth, with users developing unique abilities that reflect their personalities and experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nen is a highly versatile and intricate power system that allows users to manipulate their own life energy, or aura, in various ways. The six categories of Nen provide a framework for understanding the different types of abilities that users can develop.
            </p>
            <p>
            Enhancement users can strengthen their physical abilities, while Emission users can project their aura as energy blasts. Manipulation users can control objects or living beings, and Transmutation users can change the properties of their aura to mimic other substances. Conjuration users can create objects out of their aura, and Specialization users possess unique abilities that do not fit into the other categories.
            </p>
            <p>
            The Nen system emphasizes creativity and strategy, as users must learn to harness their abilities in innovative ways to overcome challenges. The development of Nen abilities is often tied to a user's personality and experiences, making each ability unique and reflective of the individual.
            </p>
            <p>
            Overall, the Nen system in Hunter × Hunter is one of the most complex and detailed power systems in anime and manga. It allows for a wide range of abilities and combat styles, while also emphasizing personal growth and creativity.
