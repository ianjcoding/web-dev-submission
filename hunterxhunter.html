    <h2>Why It’s Not Among the Big Three</h2>
    <p>
      <em>Hunter × Hunter</em> is often called the "Uncrowned King" of shōnen anime. 
      Despite its massive popularity and critical acclaim, it is not officially part of the Big Three. 
      The term "Big Three" was coined in the 2000s to describe <strong>One Piece</strong>, 
      <strong>Naruto</strong>, and <strong>Bleach</strong>—the three titles that dominated manga sales, 
      anime broadcasting slots, and cultural influence at the same time. 
    </p>
    <p>
        While <em>Hunter × Hunter</em> shares many qualities with these giants—such as a deep, evolving plot, 
        complex characters, and a unique power system called <strong>Nen</strong>—it never quite reached the same 
        level of mainstream dominance due to its <strong>irregular publication schedule</strong> and 
        <strong>frequent hiatuses</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Hunter × Hunter</em> missed inclusion largely because of its <strong>irregular publication schedule</strong>. 
      While beloved for its intricate storytelling, power system, and character depth, 
      frequent hiatuses prevented it from maintaining the same continuous mainstream dominance.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, its influence on the shōnen genre is undeniable, inspiring many subsequent series and earning a dedicated global fanbase.
        It is often praised for its mature themes, strategic battles, and emotional depth, setting it apart from its contemporaries.
    </p>
    <p>
        Created by Yoshihiro Togashi, <em>Hunter × Hunter</em> follows Gon Freecss as he embarks on a journey to become a Hunter and find his father. 
        The series is praised for its complex characters, moral ambiguity, and innovative battle strategies.
    </p>

    <h2>Its Unique Influence</h2>
    <p>
      - Introduced one of the most versatile and complex power systems: <strong>Nen</strong>.<br>
      - Balanced lighthearted adventure with dark, mature storytelling.<br>
      - Inspired countless other manga and anime, including direct influences on the Big Three themselves.<br>
      - Praised for deconstructing traditional shōnen tropes while still delivering emotional highs and thrilling battles.
    </p>
    <p>
        Its influence is seen in many modern shōnen series that emphasize strategic battles and moral ambiguity.
    </p>

    <h2>Legacy</h2>
    <p>
      Even though it isn’t officially part of the Big Three, 
      many fans and critics regard <em>Hunter × Hunter</em> as superior in writing and thematic depth. 
      Its absence from the Big Three list isn’t due to lack of quality but rather timing and 
      consistency of publication. For that reason, it proudly stands as the <strong>Uncrowned King</strong>.
    </p>
